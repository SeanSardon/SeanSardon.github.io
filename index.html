        		<h1>Sean Sardon's Blog!</h1>

				This blog will tell you all about myself and what i've been up to. So continue on and Enjoy!</p>

				<p> My full name is Sean Isaac Fernandez Sardon and im currently 15 years old. I was born and 
				raised here in Hawaii from a full filipino family. Here at James Campbell I am a average 
				student with a 3.5 GPA and I play for Campbell's boys basketball team entering my sophmore season
				looking to comeback after a heartbreaking season last year. As of right now math is one of my strongest 
				subjects but i'm looking to change that this year, I would like to try to get more involve in multiple subjects more. 
				This being my sophmore year and apparently one of the most important years of High school
				My goal for this year is to strive for a 4.0 and be more involved in school than only playing High School basketball.</p>

				<p> As a kid though I was athletic I was very shy at the same time. Crazy Huh lol! I wouldn't talk to nobody and 
				was just isolated. I wouldn't talk to know one at all for example the kids at school and even my teammates for 
				my sports team. As I got older I was able to get more comfortable with the people around me and throughout the years I
				met a lot of new people. When I get older my dream is to play college basketball, I want to go to a good college while
				still playing basketball which I love to do. So this all about me and the goals im striving for in life!</p>
