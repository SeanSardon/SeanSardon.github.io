        		<h1>Sean Sardon's Blog!</h1>
				<p>I'm a 10th grade student that attends JCHS and welcome to my website. 
				This blog will tell you all about myself and what i've been up to. So continue on and Enjoy!
				<p> My full name is Sean Isaac Fernandez Sardon and im currently 15 years old. I was born and 
				raised here in Hawaii from a full filipino family. Here at James Campbell I am a average 
				student with a 3.5 GPA and I play for Campbell's boys basketball team entering my sophmore season
				looking to comeback after a heartbreaking season last year. As of right now math is one of my strongest 
				subjects but i'm looking to change that this year, I would like to try to get more involve in multiple subjects more. 
				This being my sophmore year and apparently one of the most important years of High school
				My goal for this year is to strive for a 4.0 and be more involved in school than only playing High School basketball.</p>
				<p> As a kid I was known to be shy
